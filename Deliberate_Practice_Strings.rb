# 1. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string concatenation (the + operator).
# first_name = "Esther"
# last_name = "Morris"
# full_name = first_name + last_name

# p full_name
# # 2. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string interpolation (the #{} operator).
# first_name = "Esther"
# last_name = "Morris"

# p "#{first_name} #{last_name}"

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to input a word. If the word is "marco", print "polo".

# word = gets.chomp
# if word == "marco"
#   p "polo"
# end

# 4. Write a program that uses variables to store three different colors, then prints out a sentence using the colors with string concatenation (the + operator).

# x = "green"
# y = "blue"
# z = "yellow"

# p "My favorite colors are" + x + y + z

# 5. Write a program that uses variables to store three different colors, then prints out a sentence using the colors with string interpolation (the #{} operator).

# color1 = "green"
# color2 = "blue"
# color3 = "yellow"

# p " #{color1} #{color2}"

# # 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter a name. If the name is not "Santa", print "You're not Santa."
# p "type something"
# name = gets.chomp
# if name == "Santa"
#   p "Bingo!"
# elsif p "Your not Santa"
# end

# # 7. Write a program that uses variables to store a book's title and author, then prints out a sentence using that information with string concatenation (the + operator).

# book1 = "The little engine that could, Mary"

# p "My favorite book is" + book1

# 8. Write a program that uses variables to store a book's title and author, then prints out a sentence using that information with string interpolation (the #{} operator).

# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter a password. If the password is "Joshua", the program responds "Shall we play a game?". For any other password, the program responds "Access denied"

# 10. Write a program that uses variables to store the names of three cities, then prints out a sentence using that information with string concatenation (the + operator).

# city1 = "Baltimire"
# city2 = "Columbus"
# city3 = "St_Louis"

# p "My favorite city is " + city1 + "then " + city2
