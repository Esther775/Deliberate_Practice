# 1. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word with all capital letters.

# word = gets.chomp

# p word.upcase

# 2. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a big number" if the number is greater than 100.

# number = gets.chomp.to_i

# if number > 100
#   p "Thats a number"
# end

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the numbers added together.

# number = gets.chomp.to_i
# number2 = gets.chomp.to_i

# 4. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word in reverse order.

# word = gets.chomp

# p word.reverse

# 5. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints the number times 10.

# number = gets.chomp

# p number * 10

# 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter two words, then prints both words on the same line in all capital letters.

# word = gets.chomp
# word2 = gets.chomp

# p word.upcase + word2.upcase

# 7. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints the number of letters in the word.

# number = gets.chomp
# p number.length

# 8. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a negative number" if the number is less than 0.

# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the two numbers multiplied together.

# number = gets.chomp
# number2 = gets.chomp

# p number.to_i * number2.to_i

# 10. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints "That's a long word" if the word has more than 5 letters.

# word = gets.chomp

# if word.length > 5
#   p "thats long"
# end
